## Event Types

### heartbeat

  "progress_pct": 63.4
}
```

### terminal
```
{
  "type": "terminal",
  "run_id": "...",
  "status": "SUCCEEDED",
  "p_value": 0.04,
  "final_equity": 107532.12,
  "artifacts": [
    {"name":"manifest.json","sha256":"..."},
    {"name":"equity.parquet","sha256":"..."}
  ]
}
```
Final event closes stream (FR-032).

## Ordering & Determinism
- Events emitted strictly in phase order (FR-026, FR-033)
- Heartbeats never reorder domain events
- Terminal event always last; stream close after flush

## Error Events (Reserved)
- Future extension for cancellation or runtime error details (ISSUE-CANCEL-001)
