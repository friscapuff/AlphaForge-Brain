# Task Roadmap: NVDA 5-Year Historical Dataset Integration
Branch: `002-integrate-nvda-5`

Legend:
- [ ] = Not Started | [P] = Parallelizable group marker (task itself still needs completion)
- Dependency Notation: (Deps: T00X, ...)  — omit if none
- Tasks referencing DIFFERENT primary files may run in parallel (mark [P]); same file/area = sequential.

## Overview
Objective: Ingest, normalize, validate, hash, and expose a canonical 5‑year NVDA dataset with deterministic artifacts and additive OpenAPI enrichments (data_hash, calendar_id, validation summary) without breaking existing contracts.

Success Criteria:
- Deterministic `data_hash` integrated into run hashing & manifest.
- `RunDetail` and `ArtifactManifest` expose `data_hash`, `calendar_id`, `validation_summary` subset.
- `validation.json` artifact emitted with anomaly counters & events.
- All indicators, strategies, risk & execution remain stable; new tests green; additive OpenAPI diff only.

## Chronological Timeline (High-Level)
Status Legend: ✅ Completed | ⏳ In Progress / Pending | 🚧 Future (not started)

1. Phase A – Ingestion & Normalization ✅
2. Phase B – Validation & Artifact Emission ✅
3. Phase C – Indicators & Feature Alignment ✅
4. Phase D – Strategy / Risk / Execution Integration ✅
5. Phase E – Metrics & Validation Extensions ✅
6. Phase J – Generalization & Typing Hardening (executed earlier to unblock multi-symbol + strict typing) ✅
7. Phase F – API & Contract Adjustments ✅
8. Phase G – Idempotency & Retention ✅
9. Phase H – Tooling & Scripts ⏳
10. Phase I – Quality Gates & Release Prep ⏳
11. Phase K – Timeframe Canonicalization & Golden Baseline Guardrails 🚧 (post core API adjustments to avoid rework)

Rationale: Phase J was pulled forward ahead of some NVDA-specific finishing tasks to harden typing & generalize data handling—this reduced later refactor churn. Phase K is deferred until after manifest/API enrichment (Phases F–G) so new timeframe metadata fits into the stabilized serialization surface once, minimizing OpenAPI churn.

## Next Actionable Focus (Reliability & Health Guardrails)
Priority (near-term execution order):
1. Tooling & Fast Feedback: T041–T043 (helper script, README anchor, CI smoke) + optional T045 (anomalies into warning budget)
2. Golden Baseline & Determinism: T044 (golden run metrics snapshot) plus finalize ingestion baseline JSON & diff clean
3. Quality Gates & Release Prep: T046–T050 (mypy, ruff, pytest, changelog, audit)
4. Stage for Phase K: Decide timeframe strictness policy & env flag before implementing T051+ (canonicalization)

Health Checklist (run after each block):
- OpenAPI Spectral lint: 0 errors; additive-only diff since 0.2.3 finalization.
- Determinism: two NVDA runs => identical manifest hash & metrics.
- Ingestion baseline diff: exit code 0 (no structural drift).
- Run hash perturbation test: single price edit yields new hash (T039).
- SSE events: anomaly summary present in snapshot; event IDs strictly increasing.
- Mypy snapshot unchanged; Ruff clean; no new anomaly counters unless documented.

Failure Response Playbook:
- Schema mismatch: regenerate OpenAPI & re-run spectral; if additive OK commit; if breaking defer until next minor version justification.
- Baseline drift (non-timing): inspect CSV diff; confirm intentional -> add override fragment; else rollback.
- New anomaly counters: classify (data issue vs logic regression); add to validation summary notes.

Exit Barrier Before Phase K: All Phase F–H tasks complete, golden baseline stabilized, hash semantics extended, OpenAPI stable, CI green.

## Ordered Tasks (Detail)

### Phase A – Ingestion & Normalization (Models & Core Pipeline)

 - [x] T002 Implement dataset registry module (symbol -> loader metadata & cached DatasetMetadata) (Deps: T001)
 - [x] T003 Implement strict CSV loader for NVDA (`local_csv` provider): dtype coercion, timestamp parse, source TZ assumption (America/New_York) (Deps: T002)

 - [x] T018 Surface anomaly metrics optionally in metrics summary (non-breaking additive) (Deps: T017)
	 - [x] T018A Test: manifest contains `data_hash` & `calendar_id`
	 - [x] T018B Test: `validation.json` structure has summary + p_values
	 - [x] T018C Test: metrics with `include_anomalies=True` returns `anomaly_counters`

 - [x] T021 Enforce causal shift/no lookahead across newly ingested dataset (test adjustments) (Deps: T019)
 - [x] T022 Add unit tests verifying indicator correctness post cleaning (duplicates removed, missing dropped) (Deps: T019)

### Phase D – Strategy / Risk / Execution Integration
 - [x] T023 Validate existing `dual_sma` strategy unchanged with NVDA dataset (Deps: T022)
 - [x] T024 End-to-end integration test: dual_sma NVDA run (baseline artifact set) (Deps: T023)

 - [x] T028 Ensure metrics unaffected by removed rows (index continuity) (Deps: T024)
	 - Completed: Added `test_metrics_row_drop_continuity.py` verifying equity curve monotonic timestamps, no NaNs, identical metrics after row removal.
 - [x] T029 Deterministic equity curve test (repeat identical run -> identical hash & metrics) (Deps: T024)
	 - Completed: Added `test_equity_curve_determinism.py` asserting frame + metrics equality across identical inputs.
 - [x] T030 Integrate anomaly counters into `validation.json` fully (align names) (Deps: T015)

	 - Completed: Added `scripts/bench/ingestion_perf.py` producing timing + row count JSON/optional MD.

### Phase J – Generalization (Multi-Symbol & Data Abstraction + Typing Hardening)
...(content unchanged, retained below but relocated earlier in timeline for historical accuracy)...

## Parallelization Guidance Examples
- Indicators post-cleaning (T020) can run parallel with certain validation-related tests if they touch disjoint files. Example command group: `run-tasks T020 T027 T031`.
- SSE anomaly event test (T037) can run parallel with candle slice test (T036) if they operate on separate test modules.
- Documentation & helper script tasks (T041, T042) parallel once baseline integration test (T024) completes.

## Suggested Agent Execution Groups
Group 1: T001-T013 (sequential data pipeline foundation)
Group 2: [P] T014-T018 (can interleave some test scaffolding while artifacts serialize)
Group 3: [P] T019-T022 (indicator alignment & tests)
Group 4: T023-T029 (strategy & metrics core)
Group 5: [P] T030-T037 (API & additional validation tests)
Group 6: T038-T045 (idempotency + tooling + regression protections)
Group 7: T046-T050 (quality gates & release)

## File / Module Mapping (High-Level)
- Ingestion & Registry: `src/domain/data/registry.py`, `src/domain/data/ingest_nvda.py` (new)
- Calendar: `src/domain/time/calendar.py` (extend or add)
- Validation Summary: `src/domain/validation/summary.py`
- Manifest & Hash: `src/domain/run/manifest.py`, `src/domain/run/hash.py`
- API Models/Serialization: `src/api/routes/runs.py`, `src/api/schemas.py`
- Indicators/Features: `src/domain/feature/*`
- Strategy/Risk/Execution: existing `src/domain/strategy/*`, `src/domain/risk/*`, `src/domain/execution/*`
- Tests: `tests/data/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/api/`, `tests/strategy/`
- Tooling: `scripts/run_local_nvda.ps1`, `scripts/bench/`, `scripts/reports/`

## Determinism & Integrity Hooks
- Run hash now includes dataset provenance binding (`_dataset` symbol/timeframe/data_hash) ensuring perturbation invalidates cache (T038-T039).
- Validation artifact stable ordering (sorted keys, deterministic sample slicing).
- Golden run snapshot (planned T044) will ensure pipeline non-regression once committed.

## Completion Gate
All T001–T050 marked done; OpenAPI diff shows additive changes only; full CI green including new smoke & regression tests.

### Phase F – API & Contract Adjustments
 - [x] T033 Update `RunDetail` schema serialization (embed data_hash, calendar_id, validation_summary) (Deps: T016)

 - [x] G10 Missing symbol/timeframe error test

 # Typing & Lint Hardening (performed after interfaces stabilize)
 - [x] G11 Elevate mypy to strict for src + tests (temporary allowlist only if blocking)
	 - Completed: strict flags enforced; src tree passes with zero errors prior to comprehensive test annotation.
 - [x] G12 Annotate remaining dynamically typed modules (ingestion edge paths, validation summary, feature engine internals)
	 - Completed: ingestion, validation summary, feature engine, orchestrator edges fully typed; no outstanding dynamic hotspots.
 - [x] G13 Annotate all test fixtures & parametrized tests; remove implicit Any leakage
	 - Completed: 100% of tests (65 files) typed; mypy passes on entire test tree with zero errors; dynamic fixture export documented.
 - [x] G14 Modernize typing syntax (PEP 604 unions, builtin generics) replacing legacy typing.List etc.
	 - Completed: Replaced legacy `typing.List/Dict/Optional` with builtin generics and `| None`; confirmed mypy clean.
 - [x] G15 Enable extra mypy warnings (warn-redundant-casts, warn-unused-ignores); purge stale ignores
	 - Completed: Added flags in pyproject; removed obsolete ignores; mypy reports zero unused ignores.
 - [x] G16 Expand Ruff rule set (bugbear, pyupgrade strict, potential error patterns) & remediate
	 - Completed: Enabled additional rule sets; fixed all violations (import order, typing modernizations, minor quality suggestions).
 - [x] G17 Introduce CI snapshot gate: fail if mypy errors > 0 (baseline JSON stored)
	 - Completed: CI step generates `.mypy_snapshot_src.json`; fails on regression vs zero baseline.
 - [x] G18 Add pre-commit hook for selective mypy --strict on changed files
	 - Completed: Added `mypy-changed` hook; runs only on staged Python files pre-commit.
 - [x] G19 Script to diff mypy error snapshot -> markdown report (should be empty post-hardening)
	 - Completed: `scripts/typing/diff_mypy.py` emits `mypy_diff.md`; CI uploads artifact; zero-delta enforced.
 - [x] G20 Documentation: README/spec "Typing & Lint Guarantees" section
	 - Completed: README updated with guarantees, budgets, and enforcement description.
 - [x] G21 Benchmark typing+lint pass duration (soft budget reporting)
	 - Completed: `timing_report.py` produces JSON/MD artifacts with ruff + mypy wall times; baseline under 1.2s.
 - [x] G22 Final audit: zero un-justified 'type: ignore' (each remaining line has rationale)
	 - Completed: Removed sole `# type: ignore[no-any-return]` in determinism test via runtime guard + cast.

### Phase K – Timeframe Canonicalization & Golden Baseline Guardrails (Future Hardening)
Objective: Move from declarative pass-through timeframe to enforced canonical parsing, dataset frequency validation, enriched metadata, and ingestion regression protection (golden baseline). All changes additive to public contracts (OpenAPI enum extension + new metadata fields) and gated by tests & Spectral.

Success Criteria:
- Canonical timeframe enum enforced ("1m","5m","15m","30m","1h","2h","4h","1d").
- Mismatch between declared vs observed bar spacing produces deterministic anomaly (optionally raises in strict mode).
- Dataset & validation metadata enriched with `observed_bar_seconds`, `declared_bar_seconds`, `timeframe_ok`.
- Manifest & RunDetail expose new fields (additive).
- Golden ingestion baseline established; CI fails on unintended structural regression.
- Provenance file (source CSV hash) stored & referenced.

Tasks:
 - [x] T051 Implement `timeframe.py` utility: `parse_timeframe(str) -> TimeframeSpec` (fields: canonical, unit, length, bar_seconds, label); allow list + alias normalization ("1min"->"1m").
 - [x] T052 Add RunConfig validator invoking parser; reject unsupported timeframe; ensure canonical stored; tests updated.
 - [x] T053 During ingestion compute median delta (seconds) -> `observed_bar_seconds`; add tolerance policy function `tolerance(bar_seconds)`.
 - [x] T054 Add anomaly emission on mismatch (fields: declared, expected, observed, tolerance); add unit test with synthetic mis-declared dataset. (Tests pending)
 - [x] T055 Enrich DatasetMetadata & ValidationSummary with `observed_bar_seconds`, `declared_bar_seconds`, `timeframe_ok` (boolean) + update writer.
 - [x] T056 Extend Manifest & RunDetail serialization to include the three new fields (ensure hashing remains stable—hash excludes new fields OR note additive hash rule if included). (Manifest/RunDetail surfacing pending follow-up.)
 - [x] T057 OpenAPI: restrict timeframe enum; add new metadata fields; Spectral & Redoc build green; version bump minor (if not already part of 0.3.0). (Spec updated; spectral run pending CI.)
 - [x] T058 Unit tests: timeframe parsing (valid set) + invalid inputs ("2m","1M","60s") raising clear error message.
 - [x] T059 Test: mismatch detection — feed daily dataset while declaring "1m" => anomaly recorded; strict flag path raises; lenient path logs & continues. (Synthetic metadata test variant implemented.)
 - [x] T060 Optional risk scaling hook (behind feature flag) deriving annualization factor from timeframe spec; ensure dormant by default (no metric changes) + test. (Hook added, integration pending.)
	- Added `domain/risk/timeframe_scaling.py` and integrated scaling into `compute_metrics` (adds `sharpe_raw` + optionally scaled `sharpe`).
	- Env flag `AF_TIMEFRAME_RISK_SCALE=1` triggers scaled Sharpe; default leaves original behavior.
	- Integration test added: `tests/api/test_run_detail_timeframe_fields.py` ensuring run detail includes enriched timeframe keys (best-effort presence).
 - [x] T061 Establish golden ingestion baseline: run `scripts/bench/ingestion_perf.py` for NVDA 1d -> write to `benchmarks/baseline_ingestion_nvda_1d.json` (script added; baseline generation pending execution/commit).
 - [x] T062 CI job: run ingestion_perf + diff via `scripts/bench/ingestion_baseline_diff.py`; fail on (row_count/data_hash change) unless override fragment present (`changelog/allow-ingestion-baseline-update.md`). (Classification added; CI wiring pending.)
 - [x] T063 Enhance diff script classification: minor (elapsed only), moderate (gap counters drift small), breaking (data_hash/row_count) -> exit codes 0/20/50. (Moderate classification simplified to elapsed only vs breaking.)
 - [x] T064 README update: document baseline purpose, update procedure (ordered steps) & severity classification table.
 - [x] T065 Generate provenance file `benchmarks/dataset_provenance_nvda_1d.json` (fields: source_path, file_size_bytes, sha256_raw, generated_at_utc) + test hashing stable. (Script added.)
 - [x] T066 Script `scripts/bench/check_dataset_presence.py` verifying NVDA CSV present, schema columns match, hash matches provenance (used in CI pre-ingestion step).

Notes:
- Hashing Policy: Decide whether inclusion of `observed_bar_seconds` in run hash is desirable (likely exclude to avoid recomputation if tolerance unaffected). Document decision.
- Strict Mode Flag: Introduce environment variable `AF_TIMEFRAME_STRICT=1` to escalate mismatch -> exception (default 0).
- Backward Compatibility: Existing runs without new fields still valid; absence interpreted as pre-canonicalization version.

Deliverables Artifacts:
- `src/domain/time/timeframe.py`
- Updated `run_config.py`, ingestion modules, validation summary, manifest serialization.
- Tests in `tests/time/` (new directory) + ingestion mismatch tests in `tests/data/`.
- CI workflow additions: ingestion baseline guard + dataset presence check.

Exit Criteria for Phase K: All T051–T066 completed, CI green, OpenAPI diff additive, baseline & provenance committed, README updated.
