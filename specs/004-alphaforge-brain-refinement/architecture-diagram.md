# Architecture Overview (Mermaid Diagram)

This document offers a simple, visual overview of how AlphaForge Brain is organized. It focuses on clarity and avoids technical jargon wherever possible.

## Big Picture
- Data is read and prepared (features)
- A strategy runs over time on that data
- Results are stored (trades, equity, validations)
- Checks are performed to ensure results are stable and reproducible

## What Lives Where
- Feature Builder: Creates indicators (like moving averages) from input data
- Strategy Engine: Decides when to buy or sell based on features
- Results: The outcomes (equity curve and list of trades)
- Validation: Statistical checks (bootstrap resampling, walkâ€‘forward testing)
- Observability: Timing and traces so you can see what happened
- SQLite Database: A simple, reliable storage file for runs and their results
- CI (Continuous Integration): Automated checks that run on every change

## Why This Matters
- Separation of concerns keeps the system understandable
- Clear storage of results makes auditing simple
- Automated checks prevent regressions and ensure trust
