# AlphaForge Brain — Acceptance Report (Phase H)

This report summarizes what was promised versus what was delivered, using plain language and traceable evidence. It is suitable for sign‑off by stakeholders.

## Summary
- Scope: Persistence, Causality/Determinism, Statistical Breadth, Pipeline/Memory, Observability/CI, Documentation
- Result: All acceptance tests and checks have passed
- Evidence: Unit, integration, validation, and end‑to‑end tests are green; CI acceptance suite passed; documentation delivered

## Targets vs Observed Outcomes

1) Determinism & Reproducibility
- Target: Identical results for identical inputs (determinism)
- Observed: Determinism replay tests produce matching hashes; equity curve determinism tests pass

2) Persistence & Provenance
- Target: Store manifest, trades, equity, validations; record provenance
- Observed: Database tables populated accordingly; round‑trip reconstruction matches content hashes

3) Statistical Validation (Bootstrap + Walk‑Forward)
- Target: HADJ‑BB heuristic, deterministic bootstrap, CI width policy
- Observed: Heuristic and fallback verified; distributions reproducible; CI width gate enforced in STRICT mode

4) Pipeline & Memory
- Target: Deterministic chunking with matching results, memory reduction benchmark
- Observed: Chunked equals monolithic features; benchmark harness available; policy thresholds enforced by tests

5) Observability & CI
- Target: Phase timing, tracing spans, error logging, phase markers, CI jobs and artifacts
- Observed: Metrics recorded in `phase_metrics`; errors captured in `run_errors`; CI scripts present and artifacts uploaded

6) Documentation
- Target: Contracts appendix, persistence quickstart, HADJ‑BB & CI width policy, architecture diagram, README updates
- Observed: All docs exist and are linked for easy navigation

## Evidence Index
- Tests: Unit/Integration/Validation/E2E all green (see CI logs)
- CI Artifacts: Determinism replay summary, schema dump, acceptance suite summary
- Documentation: Under `specs/004-alphaforge-brain-refinement/`
  - `contracts-appendix.md`
  - `persistence-quickstart.md`
  - `hadj-bb-ci-width-policy.md`
  - `architecture-diagram.md`
  - `validation-checklist.md`
  - This report: `ACCEPTANCE.md`

## Sign‑Off
- Recommendation: Accept Phase H as complete based on the above evidence.
- Next Steps: Monitor CI, collect feedback, and consider promoting strict‑plus type/lint overlays if not already enforced.
