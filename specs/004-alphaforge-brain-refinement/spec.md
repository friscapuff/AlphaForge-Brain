## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Context Summary
The "Brain" is the deterministic core backtest + validation + artifact engine. Recent phases established: deterministic hashing, manifest chaining (`manifest.json` + `chain_prev`), anomaly counter surfacing, statistical validation (permutation first; bootstrap / Monte Carlo / walk-forward scaffolding), strict typing & lint gating, and governance docs for future strategy registry expansion. This refinement feature consolidates and elevates reliability, transparency, and readiness for incremental advanced validation and multi-symbol preparation without overextending scope.

### High-Level Objectives
1. Strengthen user trust in determinism & integrity (visible guarantees, explicit counters, reproducible lineage).
2. Clarify and standardize robustness signals (permutation outputs, future bootstrap/walk-forward placeholders) so results are interpretable and comparable across runs.
3. Reduce ambiguity in artifact semantics (manifest, validation summary, anomaly counters) to ease downstream tooling and prospective UI integration.
4. Prepare for additive validation methods and strategy governance without introducing premature complexity.
5. Enhance discoverability of run progress & integrity status for a single power user orchestrating many experiments.

### Out of Scope (Explicit Exclusions)
- Multi-user authentication / roles (future roadmap; not required for single-user lab).
- Distributed execution / remote permutation backends (protocol stub exists; implementation deferred).
- Portfolio-level multi-symbol execution semantics (current focus remains single-symbol NVDA dataset baseline; multi-symbol only considered for forward schema neutrality).
- UI layer or visualization beyond existing deterministic artifacts.
- External webhooks, replay endpoints, or artifact diff APIs (listed in broader roadmap but excluded from this refinement slice).

### Assumptions
- Single technical power user operates system locally or within a controlled environment.
- Dataset snapshot (NVDA baseline) remains the canonical ingestion target during this refinement phase.
- All additions must remain additive to public contracts (OpenAPI, manifest, validation summary) preserving constitution principles.

### Open Questions / Ambiguities
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is a formal robustness composite score required in this refinement or deferred until bootstrap & walk-forward land?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should validation summary expose p-value thresholds (e.g., caution bands) or leave interpretation to client?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is retention policy (e.g., keep newest 100 runs) to be revisited for configurable limits in this feature?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are performance target baselines (latency / throughput) part of refinement acceptance or tracked separately?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should anomaly counters be extended with severity tiers or remain raw counts?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is explicit provenance diff tooling (baseline drift classification) included now or in a later validation gate?]

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a single power user running iterative trading strategy experiments, I want every run to produce a transparent, reproducible artifact set with clear robustness and anomaly context so that I can trust comparisons between runs and avoid misleading overfitting signals.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a previously executed configuration and identical dataset snapshot, **When** I resubmit the same run request, **Then** I receive the same run identifier and the system reuses existing artifacts without recomputation.
2. **Given** a completed run, **When** I request run details with anomaly inclusion enabled, **Then** I see a stable `anomaly_counters` structure (empty object if none) and a validation summary consistent with recorded artifacts.
3. **Given** an in-progress run, **When** I stream events, **Then** I observe a deterministic ordered sequence ending in completion with no missing phase markers.
4. **Given** a completed run, **When** I inspect `manifest.json`, **Then** all listed artifact file hashes are consistent with disk contents and the manifest includes a `chain_prev` linking to the immediately prior manifest hash (or null/absent for genesis).
5. **Given** a set of multiple completed runs with identical base seed but different strategy parameter variants, **When** I compare their validation summaries, **Then** permutation-derived fields are present and interpretable, with no extraneous implementation metadata.

### Edge Cases
- Re-submission immediately after a prior run completes (no race producing duplicate or diverging manifests).
- Empty or rare anomaly conditions (still surfaces anomaly counters map consistently).
- Missing optional future validation modules (spec remains additive; no broken expectations when only permutation available).
- Corrupted single artifact file (hash mismatch detectable conceptually‚Äîoperational detection may rely on future integrity verification tooling) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is automated integrity re-verification part of this feature?].
- Dataset drift attempt (modified source CSV) leading to changed data hash‚Äîrun considered distinct; reuse not triggered.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST reuse an existing run (same hash) when an identical configuration and dataset snapshot are submitted.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST produce a manifest enumerating each primary artifact with deterministic SHA-256 hashes and a chain link to the prior manifest (or explicit genesis state).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST expose a validation summary object containing key anomaly counters and integrity indicators without requiring artifact file downloads for quick inspection.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST surface anomaly counters in run detail responses whenever the user opts in via a flag, providing an empty object if no anomalies exist.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST emit a deterministic, ordered event sequence for each run, enabling clients to reconstruct lifecycle progression.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST ensure that re-running with altered dataset content (changed data hash) yields a new run hash and does not overwrite or mutate prior artifacts.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST maintain additive evolution of public contracts (no removal or semantic mutation of existing fields in manifest, run detail, or validation summary within this refinement scope).
- **FR-008**: The system MUST provide permutation validation outputs (e.g., p_value, distribution-derived summary fields) in the validation artifact and ensure the summary subset remains coherent.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST retain stable field naming conventions for robustness-related outputs to enable longitudinal comparison across runs.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST allow clients to distinguish reused vs newly executed runs (e.g., via an existing reused indicator in response metadata or a consistent absence/presence pattern) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact signaling mechanism not specified].
- **FR-011**: The system MUST document determinism and reuse expectations so that a user can manually verify reproducibility using public artifacts.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST avoid introducing multi-user scope (auth, roles) changes as part of this refinement.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST not introduce non-deterministic randomness into validation or execution phases; any randomness source must remain seed-derived and reproducible.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST clearly separate robustness (statistical) outputs from performance metrics to reduce interpretability confusion.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST continue providing anomaly counters even if new validation modules (bootstrap, walk-forward) are later added‚Äîrefinement must not block future extension.
- **FR-016**: The system MUST ensure that absence of future validation modules (bootstrap, Monte Carlo, walk-forward) does not degrade existing permutation outputs or summary clarity.
- **FR-017**: The system MUST allow a user to detect if a manifest is part of a continuous chain (non-genesis) via presence of a prior link field or equivalent.
- **FR-018**: The system MUST provide sufficient information in run detail + manifest for an external tool to verify all artifacts exist and are hash-matching (integrity baseline) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: whether automated verification tooling is in-scope].
- **FR-019**: The system MUST present validation summary fields without exposing internal implementation or intermediate distribution samples (kept in full artifact where needed).
- **FR-020**: The system MUST maintain identical output (hash-equivalent artifacts) for identical inputs after non-functional refactors (assuming dataset unchanged) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: scope of acceptable hash drift due to formatting refactors?].
- **FR-021**: The system MUST document expected event sequence so users can assert phase completeness when streaming or polling.
- **FR-022**: The system MUST ensure that anomaly counters never cause response shape drift (empty dict vs omission) when inclusion flag is set.
- **FR-023**: The system MUST supply provenance indicators (data_hash, calendar_id) enabling cross-run dataset equivalence checks.
- **FR-024**: The system MUST keep retention behavior stable (e.g., keep newest N) unless explicitly re-scoped in a separate feature [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm retention value configurability].
- **FR-025**: The system MUST avoid adding fields that leak future uncommitted roadmap concepts (e.g., strategy registry governance internals) into current public summaries.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Run**: Logical execution instance defined by configuration, dataset snapshot identity, and seed; produces deterministic artifacts and validation outputs.
- **Artifact Manifest**: Integrity index enumerating artifact files (name, size, hash) plus chain linkage to prior manifest enabling tamper-evidence.
- **Validation Summary**: Condensed anomaly and statistical integrity indicators derived from full validation artifact (e.g., subset of permutation outputs + counters) for quick UI or script consumption.
- **Anomaly Counters**: Structured map (string -> integer) representing detected data irregularities (gaps, expected closures, etc.). No severity tiers (yet) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: potential tiering].
- **Dataset Provenance**: Identifiers (symbol, data_hash, calendar_id) establishing dataset equivalence across runs.
