# Testing Delta (Tackle-All Pass)

This document summarizes the additions, removals, and notable changes introduced during the comprehensive hygiene & coverage uplift.

## Added Test Modules
- `tests/unit/services/test_services_core.py`
  - Covers services: metrics (empty + basic), equity import path, execution import path.
  - Validates EquityBar synthetic series metrics pipeline.
- `tests/unit/services/test_chunking.py`
  - Exercises chunk slicing iterator (`iter_chunk_slices`) including edge slice sizing.
- `tests/unit/test_cold_storage_negative.py`
  - Negative-path offload/restore behaviors (invalid directory, missing manifest, hash mismatch scenarios).
- `tests/unit/test_time_and_credentials.py`
  - Covers timestamp helpers and credentials fallbacks (env var absence paths).
- `tests/unit/test_metrics_calculator_edges.py`
  - Edge cases for metrics calculator (single bar, zero returns, volatility zero division guard).
- `tests/unit/test_model_instantiation.py`
  - Instantiation & validation of key Pydantic models (DatasetSnapshot, ExecutionConfig, StrategyConfig, etc.) with enum + boundary coverage.

## Modified Test Modules
- `tests/unit/services/test_chunking.py` updated to switch from deprecated/removed API to `iter_chunk_slices`.
- Existing run/orchestrator/retention tests left intact; no behavioral changes required.

## Removed / Dead Code Cleanup
- `domain/run/async_orchestrator.py` (unused) retained only in historical path during initial pass; scheduled for deletion or isolation. Test suite no longer references it.

## Import Hygiene Adjustments
- Replaced relative imports in `services.equity` and `services.execution` with absolute imports to ensure direct module importability under pytest's path layout.
- Similar earlier patch applied to `services.metrics`.

## Coverage Impact Highlights
- Introduced direct coverage for: services metrics, equity aggregation placeholder, execution rounding logic (import path), chunk slicing utilities, negative cold storage flows, model schema validation, and metrics edge handling.
- EquityBar validator now indirectly exercised via synthetic bar construction with drawdown consistency checks.

## Follow-Up Opportunities
- Expand `services.execution` tests to assert rounding modes across boundaries (lot size transitions, fractional quantities).
- Add explicit tests for `services.equity.build_equity` once trade generation pathways are finalized.
- Increase coverage of `infra.cold_storage` success paths (currently focused on happy round trip + new negative cases).
- Migrate any remaining dead/unused domain validation modules or add minimal smoke tests if slated for retention.

## Rationale
Targeted low-risk additions maximize structural coverage (models/services/utilities) without entangling high-latency integration paths. Import path fixes ensure stability under varied PYTHONPATH resolutions.
