# Cleanup Report (AlphaForge Brain)

Date: 2025-09-23

## Summary
- Goal: Remove obsolete, generated, or legacy root-level files; ensure nothing required for builds/tests/CI was removed.
- Approach: Inventory the root, cross-check references across the repo (CI, Dockerfile, scripts), and delete safe-to-remove artifacts.

## Removed Files (root)
- coverage.xml — Generated by CI; ignored by .gitignore; not required locally.
- typing_timing.json — Generated by CI/scripts; safe to remove locally.
- typing_timing.md — Generated by CI/scripts; safe to remove locally.
- virt_report.json — Local environment probe output; ignored by .gitignore.
- base-1758390626672-a3cgoudfafn.yaml — Temporary artifact; not referenced.
- base-1758390645499-6dk5ol5gib.yaml — Temporary artifact; not referenced.
- base-1758390676987-izwqfvi8qwr.yaml — Temporary artifact; not referenced.
- head-1758390676987-ycrg31lf2f.json — Temporary artifact; not referenced.
- mypy_baseline.txt — Intermediate generated during typing diff; replaced by clean state.
- mypy_final.txt — Intermediate generated during typing diff; replaced by clean state.
- mypy_diff.md — Intermediate diff report; not needed post-migration.
- diff_test.md — Temporary diff artifact; obsolete.

## Verified Safe by Cross-References
- .github/workflows/ci.yml references coverage.xml and typing_timing artifacts only as outputs to upload; not required inputs.
- .gitignore lists coverage.xml and virt_report.json explicitly.
- Dockerfile and Makefile do not depend on any removed files.

## Deferred/Kept
- requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, poetry.lock — Kept; required by Docker/Poetry.

## Next Steps
- Keep root clean; artifacts belong under `artifacts/` or `zz_artifacts/` if needed transiently.
- CI already uploads generated files; no need to commit them locally.
- pytest-asyncio defaults pinned in `pytest.ini` (asyncio_mode=auto, asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope=function) to silence warnings.

## 2025-09-24 Follow-up
- Confirmed and removed residual generated artifacts from repo root: `coverage.xml`, `typing_timing.json`, `typing_timing.md`, `mypy_baseline.txt`, `mypy_final.txt`, `mypy_diff.md`, `diff_test.md`, any `base-*.yaml`, and any `head-*.json`. Also ensured `virt_report.json` is absent.
- Cross-checked CI workflow references; these files are produced/uploaded in CI only and are not required as inputs.
- Post-cleanup validation: test suite passes (pytest all green; one skipped marked test as expected).
