# Shared Utilities

Pure, dependency-light helpers allowed here (e.g., hash utilities, small functional helpers).

Constraints:
- No side effects (no network, filesystem writes, database access).
- No imports from `alphaforge-brain` or `alphaforge-mind`.
- Stable APIs; breaking changes require coordination.
